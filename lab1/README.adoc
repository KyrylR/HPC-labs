= Matrix-Vector Multiplication Performance Analysis

== Introduction

The number of scalar operations stem:[N] required for matrix-vector multiplication for a given matrix size stem:[ \text{Size} ] is given by:

latexmath:[N = \text{Size} \times \text{Size} \times 2 - \text{Size}]

This formula captures both the multiplications and the additions required for the multiplication of a matrix row with a vector.

=== Execution Time of a Single Scalar Operation

The execution time stem:[ \tau ] of a single scalar operation is derived from a pivot experiment, where the real execution time for a matrix of size 5,000 was provided:

latexmath:[ \tau = \frac{\text{Real Execution Time for Size 5,000}}{N} ]

Where stem:[ N ] is the number of scalar operations for a matrix of size 5,000.

=== Theoretical Execution Time

The theoretical execution time stem:[ T ] for a matrix of size stem:[ \text{Size} ] is given by:

latexmath:[ T = \tau \times (\text{Size} \times \text{Size} \times 2 - \text{Size}) ]

=== Theoretical Execution Time Calculation

Given that the execution time for matrix-vector multiplication of size 5,000 is stem:[32.898] ms (or stem:[0.032898] seconds), we use this value as our pivot to calculate the execution time stem:[ \tau ] of a single scalar operation.

Using the provided formula:
latexmath:[ N = \text{Size} \times \text{Size} \times 2 - \text{Size} ]

For matrix size 5,000, the number of scalar operations stem:[ N ] is:
latexmath:[ N = 5,000 \times 5,000 \times 2 - 5,000 ]

Now, latexmath:[ \tau = \frac{\text{Real Execution Time for Size 5,000}}{N} ]
latexmath:[ \tau = \frac{0.032898}{N} ]

Once we have stem:[ \tau ], we can use it to calculate the theoretical execution time stem:[ T ] for each matrix size using the formula:
latexmath:[ T = \tau \times ( \text{Size} \times \text{Size} \times 2 - \text{Size} ) ]

Let's calculate stem:[ \tau ] and then compute the theoretical execution times for each matrix size.

We have the execution time stem:[ \tau ] of a single scalar operation as approximately stem:[ 6.5796 \times 10^{-6} ] seconds.

Using this value, we can calculate the theoretical execution times for each matrix size as follows:

The conversions are as follows:

* 1 second = stem:[ 10^9 ] nanoseconds (ns)
* 1 second = stem:[ 10^6 ] microseconds (µs)
* 1 second = stem:[ 10^3 ] milliseconds (ms)
